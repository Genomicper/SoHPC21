# Minutes for 28/06/22 

**DONM** : 13/09, 2pm.

# Present

 * Mario Antonioletti [MA]
 * Pau Navarro [PN]
 * Claudia Cabrera [CC]

# Actions

# New and ongoing

- [ ] **All (Claudia to lead)** choose a framework for packages to use from the output of benchmarks. Prioritise by memory and speed.
    * `Data.table` is preferred.
- [ ] **Mario** enumerate pros/cons of using data.table/tibbles
  * Interesting comparison: https://jozef.io/r917-fread-comparisons/
  * [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly) states data.tables are faster especially for larger data sets.
- [ ] **Silvia** have a constructively critical look at genomicper.
  Problems installing across all platfroms, `reactome.db` seems to the issue (where the pathways come from). Need to use [bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/reactome.db.html) to install.
- [ ] **Claudia** try running the 30M data set (16Gb memory).
- [ ] **Mario** run more the 30M data set (32Gb memory).  
- [ ] **Pau**/**Silvia** find the best way of reading the 30M data set.

   * Used `fread` as a data.frame to use `RSQLite` - able to read
   * Can the merging of the annotations be done faster with `RSQLite`?
- [ ] **Claudia** Come up with a simple circos plot.

### Completed


## Notes

People have been very busy so not making progress. We shall see if we can get an MSc student in Edinburgh or Queen Mary towards the end of the year to see if they might be interested in progressing this work and leverage this work.
