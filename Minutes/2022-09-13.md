# Actions

# New and ongoing

- [ ] **All (Claudia to lead)** choose a framework for packages to use from the output of benchmarks. Prioritise by memory and speed.
    * `Data.table` is preferred.
- [ ] **Mario** enumerate pros/cons of using data.table/tibbles
  * Interesting comparison: https://jozef.io/r917-fread-comparisons/
  * [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly) states data.tables are faster especially for larger data sets.
- [ ] **Silvia** have a constructively critical look at genomicper.
  Problems installing across all platfroms, `reactome.db` seems to the issue (where the pathways come from). Need to use [bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/reactome.db.html) to install.
- [ ] **Claudia** try running the 30M data set (16Gb memory).
- [ ] **Mario** run more the 30M data set (32Gb memory).  
- [ ] **Pau**/**Silvia** find the best way of reading the 30M data set.

   * Used `fread` as a data.frame to use `RSQLite` - able to read
   * Can the merging of the annotations be done faster with `RSQLite`?
- [ ] **Claudia** Come up with a simple circos plot.

### Completed


## Notes

Will put in one (or more) proposals to EPCC. Mario to send out previous proposal(s).
Claudia may submit more to QML. All to look through the proposals and modify accordingly.
