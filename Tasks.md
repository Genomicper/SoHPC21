Things to do/look at:
1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) also install Rtools (if you are using windows).
2. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
3. Familiarise yourself with R. There are a whole bunch of good free R books at:
   * https://bookdown.org/
   In particular the R packages book:
   * https://r-pkgs.org/
   I don't think you need to know much R to work your way through this and you will be working with an R package.
   There are some other good books available here. For a more basic R tutorial look at what the Carpentries have, for instance:
   * http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/
   I have a minimised version of this course I have used in the past at:
   * https://github.com/marioa/trieste
4. You will want to install git for windows though if you have GitHub Desktop you will probably already have it. RStudio supports git and you are better using this over GitHub Desktop. To install the command line client go to:
   * https://git-scm.com/download/win
   then have a look at:
   * https://happygitwithr.com/
   Once you move on to remote computers you will probably need to learn a bit about the command line, have a look at:
   https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
   Possibly up to the end of chapter 3 - don't worry if you do not get it all in one go. I am still learning and I have been using this for years.
